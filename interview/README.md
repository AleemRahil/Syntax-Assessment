# Syntax IAP Technical Interview

Thank you for applying to the Syntax IAP Team.

The goal of this technical interview is to assess the seniority level of the
candidates.

Questions are included in the `questions` directory and each subdirectory will
contain its own `README.md` describing the expectations for each question.

## Setup

The coding question are expected to be completed using Python >=3.8.

We created a project file under `pyproject.toml` which is understood by
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs); which we recommand you use to setup
your virtual environment.

Once both Python and Poetry are installed, you could run:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
poetry install  # From the same directory where `pyproject.toml` is located.
```

The setup steps under Windows are slighly different and left to the reader as
an exercice.

## Workflow

This interview format is meant to be realistic: looking up information on the
Internet is expected. We also believe a developer works better when there is
not somebody looking over their shoulders. This is why the technical portion of
the interview is conducted this way.

Feel free to add any dependencies to the project to help you in your
implementations.

If any question is unclear or you need any clarification to complete any of the
question, please email `damien.levac@syntax.com` for assistance. Asking for a
clarification will not penalize the candidate in any way.

## What we are looking for.

Candidates will be evaluated on the following:

* Understanding of software development best practices.
* Ability to write clear and concise code.
* Ability to follow instructions.
* Quality of the technical documentation provided.

Code submitted as part of this technical assessment will not be used by Syntax
for any other purpose than to evaluate the seniority of candidates.
